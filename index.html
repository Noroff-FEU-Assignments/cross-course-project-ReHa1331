   <h1>Hello world!</h1>
   <p>Welcome to my first website.</p> 
<h2>Web Security</h2>
<pid="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
<pid="web-security-answer"><b>There are many people who are not aware of all the threats we can face online. In the dangerous world of the internet, some of the biggest cyber threats are Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery.</b><br>

  

To have a guaranteed secure website, no single tool can be perceived as the only measure. The strongest web security is a combination of several security applications.<br>

  

The advice I can give a potential client is; <br>

  

-To be protected against such web threats, all parts of a website must be protected 

-It is important to take frequent tests during the development of the website so that you do not struggle with security problems afterwards. 

-Security should be the first priority in program development. By practicing SecDevOps, you will discover the security problems before they have to appear. 

-It is important to adopt a cyber security framework. The cyber security framework research security risks and develops a response plan. 

-Integrate vulnerability scanners into the website, and the website will automatically be tested for cyber threats. This means less manual work and fewer errors. It is best to combine the vulnerability scanner together with the network scanner. 

-The URL should start with HTTPS, instead of HTTP.  

-Use a web application firewall (WAF) 

-Two-factor authentication 

 

All software developers should be educated and knowledgeable about security issues and how to prevent them. They should be able to secure coding techniques, algorithms and tools required to build secure web applications. </p>
